### Simulation-of-the-basic-Inter-Process-Communication-system-of-Akaros-and-Tornado.

Akaros uses shared memory and tornado, message passing for IPC and these are simulated by UCQs(Un-bounded Concurrent Queues)
and server-client communication respectively.”Optimizing IPC Performance for Shared − Memory Multiprocessors” paper
was referred for the latter.
